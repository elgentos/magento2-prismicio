title: Introduction

For the love of Magento and Prismic we created a module to do a seamless integration between the two.
It is a full replacement for the default CMS in Magento.

This documentation should get you started and will contain useful information how to link Prismic and Magento.

## TLDR
Just install the module and start hacking.

```bash
composer require elgentos/module-prismicio
bin/magento module:enable Elgentos_PrismicIO
bin/magento setup:upgrade
```
